Last weekend I happened to be completely off the network. We somehow managed to forget to pay a couple of DSL bills (now set up to be paid automatically), and the ISP "cut the wires". Staying off the Internet provided loads of benefits. Let's see.






  1. **More time with the loved one.** Of course I managed to spend more time with my loved one, cook together, watch a movie, just sit watching the telly and talking.


  2. **Health benefits.** I felt overall more relaxed, and my eyes felt much better. Especially because the previous 2 weeks had been very intense, so my left eye had some red in it.


  3. **More time to read.** With no Internet, I spent a lot of time reading books that were waiting to be finished.


  4. **More productivity.** This sounds crazy, but I did some coding for a project of mine that didn't really need network access (no need to check API online, no need to talk with a team mate, etc), and without distraction I was able to do more coding than the previous week.


  5. **More time outside.** Not having much better to do, going to the shop to fetch food didn't really feel like wasted time.


  6. **More TV.** Oh wait, this is not a benefit at all, is it?


  7. **Less IRC.** When I could connect to my running [GNU/Screen](www.gnu.org/software/screen/) session which was holding [my IRC client](http://www.irssi.org/) in my office computer, I found out all the old messages. And that I missed the chance to buy tickets for a gig I wanted to go to.
  8. 

  9. **Less Usenet.** Do you think I cought up with all the threads? Of course I had to go for "mark all as read" and forget it.


  10. **Less RSS.** My [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) had the infamous **100+** count of news... but I didn't give up and managed to go through all of them.





**What did I found out?**
Well, nothing new, really. I already know I was addicted to IRC, RSS and USENET! But of course this break reminded me that I can do perfectly fine without.






**Conclusion**
I will probably spend more weekends off the net. **Not.**
