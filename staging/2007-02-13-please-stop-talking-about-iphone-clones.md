I can read, basically every other day, [some website](http://www.smh.com.au/news/phones--pdas/samsungs-iphone-lookalike/2007/02/10/1170524349842.html) going nuts about some _[iPhone](http://www.iovene.com/index.php?s=iphone) clone_. Just few minutes ago I read about the [nVidia GoForce 6100](http://www.engadget.com/2007/02/13/nvidias-goforce-6100-no-its-not-another-iphone-clone/), and [googling for "iPhone clone"](http://www.google.com/search?q=iPhone+clone&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&rls=Swiftfox:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-a) really confirms the fuss. Well, the truth is that the iPhone actually is the one coming late, possibly the **cloner**, rather than the **cloned**.




I'm not working at [Apple Inc.](http://www.apple.com/), but, being a [software developer](/cv) and happening to have also worked for a while in the development process of [a high tech device](http://www.nseries.com/campaigns/n800/internet/), I know, as many others, that the process that leads to the birth of a complicated gadget like the iPhone, takes years.




[Digg.com](http://www.digg.com/) has gone completely crazy about the subject. [A Google Search](http://www.google.com/search?q=iphone+clone+site%3Adigg.com&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&rls=Swiftfox:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-a) about that subject on Digg, returns 5520 results.




Given that Apple Inc. will release the iPhone only next Fall, and that there are many devices already out there, which have been yelled at as mere "clones" (absolutely disrespectfully, IMHO), how can you people abuse the term so much? I'm assuming that nothing really serious leaked from Apple, so the competitors didn't just rush to make their own touch screen phones. The truth is that the technology started to be ready, and the market started to be ready too, at the same time. Some people missed the opportunity and [couldn't even accept it](http://www.iovene.com/steve-ballmer-on-the-iphone-pathetic/), some other realized the chance and went for it.




I hope that the abuse of the word "clone" will cease to exist, and that, from now on, everybody will just talk about "another touch screen phone".





Here's a photo-list of alleged "iPhone clones" so far.
