During some moonless hours, this August, I aimed my telescope to NGC 7129,
a beautiful reflection nebula in Cepheus.

> Young suns still lie within dusty NGC 7129, some 3,000 light-years away

> noticeable in the sharp image are the lovely bluish dust clouds that reflect
> the youthful starlight. But the compact, deep red crescent shapes are also
> markers of energetic, young stellar objects. Known as Herbig-Haro objects,
> their shape and color is characteristic of glowing hydrogen gas shocked by
> jets streaming away from newborn stars. Paler, extended filaments of reddish
> emission mingling with the bluish clouds are caused by dust grains
> effectively converting the invisible ultraviolet starlight to visible red
> light through photoluminesence.  Ultimately the natal gas and dust in the
> region will be dispersed, the stars drifting apart as the loose cluster
> orbits the center of the Galaxy. *(APOD)*

I collected 14.8 hours in LRGB over the course of five nights.

The image can be seen on [AstroBin as well][1].
