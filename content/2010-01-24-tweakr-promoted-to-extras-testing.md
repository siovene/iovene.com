Hi, a quick update on
[Tweakr](http://maemo.org/packages/package_instance/view/fremantle_extras-devel_free_armel/tweakr/0.0.15-1/):
it has now been promoted to **extras-testing**, since the reboot loop bug
(thanks, _hildon-home_!) has been fixed.

Also a new feature present: the Profile button in the Status Menu gets replaced
by Tweakr's own button (which looks identical), so that you won't have get your
Status Menu too crowded.
