M31 and M33, which I have imaged before ([here ](/381/)and [here](/410/)) are
two spiral galaxies that are part of our Local Group. Unfortunately this
picture doesn't show much of them, and the fault falls on the usual suspects:
little time after darkness to image them before they set behind the artificial
landscape of my human neighborhood, the ever standing light pollution, the
guider camera out for repair.

Nonetheless this is a nice framing which I should integrate more and get a
little better. I wish I had clean skies.
