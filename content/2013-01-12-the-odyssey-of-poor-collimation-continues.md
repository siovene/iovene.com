This telescope is proving really troublesome, and I really hope it will
ultimately be worth it. Samuel has been trying to collimate the secondary
mirror for several hours, on two nights. Not only would the pinching not really
go away, but getting a good collimation was a frustrating and ultimately futile
effort.

I've been told that it's extremely unlikely that the primary mirror was pinched
and/or uncollimated, but there's no way that fiddling with the secondary mirror
for over 6 hours would yield no acceptable result.

In the following image you can see the extent of the decollimation. It's pretty
serious.

Stacking 46 frames helped, because with many images having been acquired after
a meridian flip, some defects averaged out, so the stars are less misshapen
albeit more bloated.

Now I have no choice than to ask to AstroCamp folks to start fiddling with the
primary mirror, and hope for the best.
