I just had a tiny window between a cluster of clouds and the next, so I took a
chance at this cluster of stars. The very well known M45, aka the Pleiads, is
an object that was identified even at pre-historic times. Homer mentioned it
already in 750 BC. It's formed by some young stars, about 100 million years of
age, and it will spread out of existence in about 250 million years.

This photograph is the stacking of 20 images of 5 minutes each.
