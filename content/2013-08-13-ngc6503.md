This new moon I decided to try a galaxy. NGC 6503 is not a commonly imaged
target: there are only seven instances on AstroBin.

It's a dwarf spiral galaxy located in the Local Void, 17 million light-years
away in the ocnstellation of Draco.

> The Local Void is a vast, empty region of space, lying adjacent to our own

> Mpc (230 million light years). The Local Void also appears to have

For this image, I let my equipment run for ten hours and twenty minutes.

The image can be seen on [AstroBin as well][1].
