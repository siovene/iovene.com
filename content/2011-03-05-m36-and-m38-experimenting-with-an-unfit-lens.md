[M36](/?s=M36) and [M38](/447/), two bright open clusters in Auriga, have been
imaged here with what I knew would be an unfit lens, but I had to be sure. This
18-200mm Canon lens presents severe chromatic and comatic aberrations, as you
can see if you click on the picture above.

Visible in this picture are also NGC1907 (better visible [here](/447/)) and
NGC1931 (which I really have to image properly when I get my guider camera
back).
