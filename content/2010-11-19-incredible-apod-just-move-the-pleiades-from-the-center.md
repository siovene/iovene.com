I find it really hard not to erupt in smothering expressions involving fierce
cursing and the invocation of man-made mythical beings, when looking at this
picture. Sadly, I did not take it. Most likely, I never will, as it's been
taken with expensive gear under crystal clear skies.  Add a solid eighteen
hours of integration to that, and the fact that on good years, I'll see
eighteen hours of cloud free skies throughout the whole year, and you will
understand the reasons for my excitement above.  The photograph shows the
familiar seven sisters, and an incredible amount of dust in the region that
extends from the Pleiades to Taurus and Orion's arm. Plus a generous amount of
tiny galaxies in the background.
