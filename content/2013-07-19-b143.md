It's unusual for me, as of late, to publish images with integration times that
are less than biblical, however this time I thought I might content after one
night only.

The image above depicts B143, that is the 142nd object of the Barnard catalog,
a dark nebula in the constellation of Aquila.

Two thousand light-years away, this a cloud of dust that is not being ignited by
any stars, therefore appearing as a black void against the tapestry of stars of
the Milky Way.

The image was acquired during the course of five hours, with a classic LRGB
composition. You can [view it on AstrBin][1] as well.
