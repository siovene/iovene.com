After an uncountable number of late nights and many a moment of abysmal dismay,
and with many things still not working properly, I can finally present the
first image in nine months whose luminance was entirely acquired by me, and
that finds my content.

I worked for a few nights on NGC 5906/7 (there's ambiguity in the naming),
collecting 51x600" luminance shots with a GSO RC8 at full focal length.

Unfortunately there isn't the faintest hint of the feeble tidal streams visible
in [Gabany's image][2].

The color data was kindly provided by Samuel Diaz Lopez.
