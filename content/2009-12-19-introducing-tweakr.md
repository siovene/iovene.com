I have been working on a little utility package for [Maemo
5](http://maemo.nokia.com/), called
[Tweakr](https://garage.maemo.org/projects/tweakr/). It's a `Settings` applet
that lets you tweak little known settings that could otherwise be changed only
by editing configuration files by hand.

It has a plugin architecture, so you could write your own plugin too. The ones
I have so far are `Desktop` and `Hardware keys.`

### Desktop

This plugin allows you to edit the labels of the bookmark shortcuts you have on
your desktop.

### Hardware keys

You can configure the behavior of the Power Key, and whether uncovering the
camera lens unlocks the device.

More plugins and feature coming soon!

Here's some screenshots:
