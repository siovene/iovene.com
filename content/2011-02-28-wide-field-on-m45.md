I know what you're thinking: this image has nothing on [this other
one](http://astronomy.fm/aapod/images/aapod/2010-12-07-1291729100.jpg)
(courtesy [AAPOD](http://astronomy.fm/aapod/)), but neither have my skies
compared to those, or my equipment compared to that one, or my lack of a guider
camera compared to the lack of such lack.

But one day, sooner or later, I'll produce pictures like that. For the time
being, I have to make do with light pollution capped images at two and half,
three minutes top (with the 50mm lens). Bear with me.
