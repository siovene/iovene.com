Here's thirty-five five-minute shots at the M92 globular cluster in Hercules.

Messier 92 is about 26,700 light-years away and one of the brightest globular
clusters of the northern hemisphere. It's often overlooked, though, because of
its proximity to the more prominent
[M13](/posts/2011/08/the-globular-cluster-m13/).

This is the first image flatted with [my new light
box](/posts/2011/08/my-diy-flat-fields-light-box/). You can't tell because this
is a crop, but the box worked well.
