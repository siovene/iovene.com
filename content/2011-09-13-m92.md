Here's thirty-five five-minute shots at the M92 globular cluster in Hercules.

Messier 92 is about 26,700 light-years away and one of the brightest globular clusters of the northern hemisphere. It's often overlooked, though, because of its proximity to the more prominent [M13](http://www.iovene.com/616/).

This is the first image flatted with [my new light box](http://www.iovene.com/578/). You can't tell because this is a crop, but the box worked well.
