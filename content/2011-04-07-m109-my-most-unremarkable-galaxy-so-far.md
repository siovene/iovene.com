Messier 109 is, to my equipment, an inconspicuous little galaxy in Ursa Major.
I don't have a lot of choice of subjects, this time of the year, and this
galaxy, measuring only 7.6 x 4.7 minutes of arc in apparent size, proved to be
a tough match.

> M109 is the brightest galaxy in the M109 Group, a large group of galaxies
> located in the constellation Ursa Major that may contain over 50 galaxies.
