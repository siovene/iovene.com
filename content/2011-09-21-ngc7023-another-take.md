Finally I had a chance to do the Iris nebula again, this time properly. The
first time I tried, the Moon was full and the sky was still slightly glowing of
sunlight, because the Sun wasn't 18 degrees below yet.

This time I managed 13 subs of 600 seconds, plus one sub of 420 seconds.

The blue part of the nebula is now clearly visible, and it extends well beyond
the core that I managed to image previously.

Even some of the dark nebulae around it hint their existence, although very
subtly.

They'd need more aperture, longer exposure times, and, of course darker skies.

Speaking of which, the sky was particularly dark last night, and I estimated a
visual limiting magnitude of 5. The absence of the snow helps!
