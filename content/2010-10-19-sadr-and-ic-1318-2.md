> SADR (Gamma Cygni). Pronounced more like "sudder" or "sadder," the star itself
> is nowhere near as obscure as its proper name. Mid-second magnitude (2.20) Sadr
> is the Gamma star of the constellation Cygnus, the Swan, and lies prominently
> at the center of Cygnus's famed asterism, the Northern Cross, at the crossing
> point of the staff and crossbar. The name, however, refers to the great ancient
> celestial bird, and comes from an Arabic phrase that means "the hen's breast."
> Sadr lies in a magnificent portion of the Milky Way as it runs along Cygnus'
> long axis. It is at the northern end of the famed Great Rift, a dark lane that
> appears to divide the Milky Way -- the disk of our Galaxy -- in two and extends
> down through Sagittarius and Scorpius. The Rift actually consists of a huge
> complex of fairly nearby dust clouds in which stars are being born. More
> detailed study of the region around Sadr show it to be filled with luminous
> interstellar clouds as well as the remnant from an exploded star, none of which
> are directly connected with it. Nevertheless, the star itself intrigues as a
> fairly unusual class F (F8) supergiant. Most of these brilliant stars are
> either fairly hot or quite cool and reddish. Few, like Sadr, are yellow-white
> and in the mid-temperature range near 6500 degrees Kelvin, not much hotter than
> the Sun. Truly luminous as befits a supergiant, the star is around 65,000 times
> brighter than the Sun. It does not dominate its part of the sky only because of
> its rather large distance of 1500 light years (its light dimmed by nearly half
> a magnitude by interstellar dust absorption). Though the star is in the process
> of dying, having ceased hydrogen fusion in its deep core, it is not possible to
> know just what state it is in and whether it will heat or cool at its surface,
> either course taking longer than any human will see. From its current
> brightness and temperature, the original mass of the star at birth must have
> been around a dozen times that of the Sun (though some estimates range higher),
> close to the limit at which stars are believed go explode as supernovae.
> However, the distance is not all that well known and Sadr might be fainter and
> less massive than supposed. Sadr is close to a region of temperature and
> luminosity in which stars become unstable and pulsate, varying in brightness.
> Though it is not obviously variable, the star does appear to pulsate somewhat
> in a complex way with a 74 day period.
>
> Sadr (near the center), in a complex region of the Milky Way, is surrounded by
> reddish interstellar clouds that are excited to glow by the ultraviolet light
> of hot stars, IC 1318.
