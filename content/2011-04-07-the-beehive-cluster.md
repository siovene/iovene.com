Back to the clusters with an evergreen: M45, aka the Beehive. This image is the
sum of 25 six-minute exposures at ISO400.

> The Beeive Cluster, also known as Praesepe (Latin for "manger"), M44, NG
> 2632, or Cr 189, is an open cluster in the constellation Cancer. It is one of
> the nearest open clusters to the Solar System, and it contains a larger star
> population than most other nearby clusters. Under dark skies the Beehive
> Cluster looks like a nebulous object to the naked eye; thus it has been known
> since ancient times. The classical astronomer Ptolemy called it "the nebulous
> mass in the breast of Cancer," and it was among the first objects that Galileo
> studied with his telescope The cluster's age and proper motion coincide with
> those of the Hyades open cluster, suggesting that both share a similar origin.
> Both clusters also contain red giants and white dwarfs, which represent later
> stages of stellar evolution, along with main sequence stars of spectral classes
> A, F, G, K, and M.  Currently there is no consensus on the cluster's distance,
> with recent sources suggesting 160 to 187 parsecs (520-610 light years). There
> is better agreement on its age, at about 600 million years. This is equivalent
> to the age of the Hyades (~625 million years). The bright central core of the
> cluster has a diameter of about 7 parsecs (22.8 light years)
