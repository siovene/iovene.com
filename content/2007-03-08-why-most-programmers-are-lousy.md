tags: coding, opinion

I've been in the IT field long enough to get to know many programmers, both
experienced and just wannabies. During this time, I've realized that most of
them are just **bad programmers**, simply said. I find myself agreeing with [a
brilliant post by Jeff
Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html), which alleges
that programmers can't program. What are the reasons for this? Many. Probably,
IMHO, the main fault has to be addressed to the lousy education that people
receive. But then again, the ability of giving education remains directly
proportional to the ability of getting it, and where I see people complaining
about low quality of education in University, I also see students with no
interest in learning. Let's see some of the reasons why programmers can't
really program.

  1. **Young people study Computer Science just because it's a trend.** It
      sounds almost unbelievable to me, but I must admit it's mostly true. The
      vast majority of my old University mates just applied to the Computer
      Science department because... well: everybody was doing so. They followed
      the rest of the sheep.

  2. **Young people study Computer Science because they wouldn't know what else
      to do.** That's really another strong source of applications to Computer
      Science. A lot of young people in their teenage years just don't know
      what they want to do as grownups. Computer Science still seems to be a
      good career opportunity, so they just go for it.

  3. **Young people study Computer Science because they think it's a sure way
      of getting a job.** 10-something years ago there was a big boom, and if
      you just knew some HTML, were thought to be a computer guru. These types
      of belief mark a deep footprint on popular sayings, hence the wave of
      people applying to Computer Science _just because they can work_, is
      still there.

  4. **Many of today's programmers, were doing nothing else than surfing the
      net or using Word till last year.** Especially in small and vertical
      based markets, improvisation just rules. People learn something, and
      literally throw themselves on the field. Drawbacks for quality of their
      work are simply inevitable. This is not only a group of illiterate people
      that just jumped in to catch the big wave (what big wave, nowadays?), but
      people with no passion whatsoever. In other words, I don't think it's
      possible, nowadays, to become a **great programmer** if you didn't start
      getting some interest in the field when you were very young, say about 10
      years old (with the due exceptions, of course).

  5. **Many of today's Computer Science students have no interest whatsoever in
      what they're forcefully studying.** Just put together the previous items
      in this list and what do you get? A bunch of people who just don't care,
      who want to get their piece of paper (the degree) as soon as possible,
      and have absolutely no passion in what they learn. That's the worst. I
      strongly believe that programming is not just a job like many others, but
      you need passion to get best at it.

  6. **A lot of programmers just don't like to program.** This goes for 100% of
      my ex University mates! Think of that: **100%**. Of course it's not the
      whole world but it makes a small statistics.

  7. **A lot of programmers just don't get it.** Not even the easy things. I
      was asked, few weeks ago, by a friend of mine who's been studying
      Computer Science for now 4 years, what the difference is between a
      `private` and `protected` method in Java. Apparently reading the books
      isn't enough anymore, nowadays. Another guy asked me: _"I've studied
      pointers in C, and I think I understood them. Still I can't find any use
      for them... are they really used at all?"_.

  8. **Basically all of the programmers, or wannabe programmers, mentioned
      above, are miles away from the technical community.** These people will
      totally ignore the existence of:
      - Slashdot and similar
      - RSS
      - Usenet
      - IRC (_"Is that like MSN?"_)
      - SVN and similar

As you can see, a really strong point, in my opinion, is the lack of **care**
and **passion** for the subject of programming itself. Lousy programmers are
bound to program to take a wage home; good ones are bound to program for the
sake of programming itself. Or course you can do that but still miss to be a
good programmer, but all falls down to numbers.

*[IMHO]: In my humble opinion
