Starting this year, I thought I would also write about my cycling, since
it has been taking a bigger and bigger part of my life lately. As I just
started this new section, I will shortly summarize my previous twenty
months of cycling.

Back in May 2013 I [got my first road
bike](|filename|/2013-05-08-new-bike-day.md), and from then on I could
not get enough of the sport. I have been riding up and down [Mt.
Grappa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Grappa) at every chance I
have had to be in Italy, and I have amassed a respactable amount of
kilometers since. I closed off 2013 with 5,000 km in the bank, and 2014
with 11,300 km. I have since changed to a different bike, a Bottecchia
Super Ottavio with Campagnolo Super Record, and in June 2014 I got a
power meter so I could train with the best possible tools and monitor my
progress scientifically.

So let us now get to the month at hand for a quick retrospective
analysis. After two months and a half of base and SST training to work
on my aerobic engine during the late fall and early winter, the second
half of January was finally the time to start with build blocks, in
order to try and be ready and in good form come Spring.

Unfortunately, though, a flu got in the way after the first week of my
build block, compromising my second and third weeks. I managed to savage
something, getting 278 TSS done on week 2, and 306 on week 3.

In theory you should increase your TSS week after week, up until your
recovery week when you do about 50% of your average TSS in your
previous weeks, so now I am left with a monstruously positive TSB and
the need to start the build block from the beginning.

It sounds incredible, but being literally only four days sick made me
lose two whole weeks of training stress and subsequent adaptations.

Anyway, January was a good month because it saw my best ever 20-minute
power, at 262 watts. I currently weigh 61.5 kg, which is a 1.5 kg gain
from my summer / race day weight, but I am pretty sure I will lose that
in April and May while keeping (and hopefully increasing) my power at
threshold. This means that my W/kg is currently at 4.04, with the
potential of being at 4.15. And I know I can squeeze a few more watts
out of these legs if I pace myself even better.

During my last 20-minute test I had some juice left at the end to
finish strong, so I will go for a steady 270 W next time.

To wrap things up, here is a summary page of the month. From February
on, I will try to increase the hours a little, getting closer to 30
hours a month, while keeping my gym regimen one to two times a week.
