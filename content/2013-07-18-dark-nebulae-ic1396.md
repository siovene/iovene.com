In the past week I've worked on collecting data on some dark nebulae in
Cepheus: B161/162/163 and others.

My setup now has an AstroPhysics CCD67 focal reducer in the optical train,
which means I'm working at a focal length of about 1225 mm, and a focal ratio
of about f/5.54. The telescope was also collimated better, and I only have a
slight residual tilt, almost invisible.

This image is a simple LRGB composition, in a 2-panel mosaic with a total
integration time of 17 hours.

Please note: no noise reduction was applied!

The dark nebulae appear in a vast field of red hydrogen emissions, which is
known as the IC1396 complex.

The image can be seen on [AstroBin][1] as well.
