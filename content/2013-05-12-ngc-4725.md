Another image, the third one, coming from the three-man team of Samuel Diaz
Lopez, Colin McGill, and me.

Unfortunately, this time too I could not contribute any actual raw data. I'm
still suffering from some unidentified problem, probably differential flexure,
so most of my subs have elongated stars.

This time we aimed our weaponry towards NGC 4725, a nice, one-armed,
intermediate barred spiral galaxy about 40 million light-years away in the
constellation Coma Berenices.

NGC 4725 is a Seyfert Galaxy, suggesting an active galactic nucleus containing
a supermassive black hole. *(Source: Wikipedia)*

The image was acquired during several nights this May, and consists of:

 * **L**: 27x900" and **Ha**: 9x1800" with a GSO RC10, Atik 4000, AP900.
 * **RGB** (38+39+48)x300" with an Ian King's Ikharos 8", Atik 460ex, Paramount
   MX.

The processing was done entirely with PixInsight 1.7.
