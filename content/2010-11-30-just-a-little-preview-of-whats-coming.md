In the last couple of nights, having been kissed by the clemency of the gods
that govern the movements of the clouds (petty gods, you know: they will know
when you buy new equipment, and they will be jealous and unleash their wrath
upon you), I have managed three hours and forty-five minutes on M31, our
neighbor galaxy which has set its four hundred billion eyes on us, and will
eventually engage in a dramatic collision with our own galaxy in a few billion
years.  Well, not such a dramatic one, actually, so don't waste too many
energies embracing for impact: during galactic merges, very few stars actually
collide, if any. Although it would be enough if an alien star swung close
enough to our solar system, to send these tiny rocks we call planets off to
places well outside their regular orbits, in the interstellar void.

But I digress. Three hours and forty-five minutes is the time in which the
sensor of my camera has been staring at M31. I plan to do a few more hours
tonight, should the gods be merciful again, and there's a lot more
post-processing involved if I want to get some decent results: I'm yet to
subtract dark and flat frames.
