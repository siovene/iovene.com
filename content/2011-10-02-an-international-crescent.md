This image is the result of a cooperation between me, a Dutch astrophotographer
named Gustaaf Prins and an Irish astrophotographer named (waiting for clearance
to disclose name.)

I acquired the OIII and SII data, $NAME acquired the Ha, and Gustaaf Prins
acquired the RGB (for the stars.)

## Data

*  **SII**: 13x900" 12nm
*  **Ha**: coming soon
*  **OIII**: 7x1800" 12nm
*  **R**: 9x300" bin2
*  **G**: 9x300" bin2
*  **B**: 9x300" bin2

## Equipment used

*  **SII and OIII**: Skywatcher ED80, Moravian G2-1600
*  **Ha**: coming soon
*  **RGB**: TS APO Triplet 90/600mm, Atik 383L+

## About NGC6888

The Crescent Nebula (also known as NGC 6888, Caldwell 27, Sharpless 105) is an
emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus, about 5000 light years away. It is
formed by the fast stellar wind from the Wolf-Rayet star WR 136 (HD 192163)
colliding with and energizing the slower moving wind ejected by the star when
it became a red giant around 400,000 years ago. The result of the collision is
a shell and two shock waves, one moving outward and one moving inward. The
inward moving shock wave heats the stellar wind to X-ray-emitting temperatures.

## Processing

The image was entirely processed in PixInsight 1.7.
