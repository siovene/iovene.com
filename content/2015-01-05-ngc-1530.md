Catching up on my backlog of images to postprocess, here I present NGC 1530, a
barred spiral galaxy in Camelopardalis.

I am not too happy with the processing this time, obviously because I am
getting quite rusty. I know that this galaxy has some very active and HÎ± rich
areas along its spiral arms, but the do not show up in my processing.

[Samuel's version](http://www.astrobin.com/133748/B/), on the other hand, shows
more than a hint of that, so perhaps I should ask him how he brought that out.

The sky background shows some subtle suggestions of the integrated flux nebula,
but it might as well be that we need to better calibrate our light frames.

The image can be seen on AstroBin too, of course,
[here](http://www.astrobin.com/146150).
