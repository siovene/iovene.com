Nothing much to say about our own satellite, portrayed here as the stacking and
processing of 1000 frames captured with my QHY5 camera at the direct focus of
my ED80 refractor with a focal length of 600mm.

Since I'm been often talking about the past and the future of the objects I
photograph, it's worth to note that our beloved Moon is slowly but surely
receding in its orbit, and sometime in the next few hundred million years, its
mission will be accomplished, because it will simply come to the point in which
the pull exerted by Mother Earth's gravity won't be enough anymore, and our
gray companion of some billion years will abandon the cradle, plunging into
deeper space, farther and farther away.

It will be a sad day.
