NGC6946, aka the Fireworks Galaxy, owes its fancy name to being the galaxy in
which the largest number of supernovae have been recorded. And that's nine.
Unfortunately my picture doesn't show any, but the galaxy is framed with the
nice and bright open cluster NGC6939.

The Fireworks Galaxy is quite near, at only ten million light-years, but lies
behind clouds of dark nebulae in our Milky Way, since it's pretty much on the
galactic plane.

Curiously, I haven't found a lot about NGC6939 online; I suppose it means that
it's a rather unremarkable open cluster.

This image is a crop because I had trouble with my flat frames (I accidentally
shifted the focus knob) and therefore you can see defects and artifacts on the
full frame. The night wasn't particularly transparent, and 3.6 hours of
exposure proved to be barely enough to show the galactic core.

And when there's so little data to work with, stretching the histogram to the
limit will show defects that are beyond the extreme care I can take in
calibrating the frames, such as [the non uniform sensitivity of the CMOS
chip](/596/).
