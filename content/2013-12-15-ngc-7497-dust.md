Across the end of November and the beginning of December 2013,
[Samuel](http://astrob.in/users/samueldl/) and I have collaborated on another
nice project. I'm really taking a liking for galaxies with nearby dust, whether
it be the Integrated Flux Nebula in our Milky Way, or some extragalctic
residual of gravitational interaction.

This image is the result of **23.2 hours** worth of data, structured as
follows:

* Luminance: **40x1200"**, GSO RC10, Atik 4000, Paramount MX
* RGB: **59x600"**, GSO RC8, Moravian Instruments G2-1600, 10Micron GM2000

The image can be seen on AstroBin as well: [NGC 7496 and dust on
AstroBin](http://www.astrobin.com/68352/).
