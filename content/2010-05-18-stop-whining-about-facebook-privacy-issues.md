category: Technology
tags: facebook, opinion, privacy

The Internet is now completely saturated by people whining about privacy on
Facebook, or lack thereof. I honestly fail to see, for instance, how its
privacy settings should be a [bewildering tangle of
options](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/12/business/facebook-privacy.html).
Facebook has hundreds of millions of users, so **yes**, it is going to be
complicated to handle the privacy settings. Besides the fact that it really
isn't. And so what if its privacy statement has a larger word count than the
Constitution of the USA? Facebook has a hundred millions users more than USA
has citizens. One glove does not fit all hands, and they need their legalese.

I agree: upgrading privacy settings so that they are less secure than they used
to is not the right way to go, but everybody is free to change them the best
way they can. The more I observe the debate evolve, the more it looks like it's
founded on conspiracy theorist delusions.

This isn't simply a matter of _"Facebook is the only game in town, so they can
and will do whatever they want"_. Facebook comes for free, and it's not really
something I would include amongst the _must-have_ services, like fresh water.
So you don't need it, and don't have to use it. If the sole fresh water
supplier in your town started to pollute the water intentionally, say so that
they could sell medicine with the other company they own, then you would have a
problem.

Otherwise, there's nothing here. What? Raising public awareness? I see. You can
do that without trying to organize Facebook-quitting days. It's OK to talk
about it, and indeed I'm doing it right now myself. But I'm just doing it
in a more constructive way: check the safety of your privacy settings by
following the instructions at
[http://www.reclaimprivacy.org/](http://www.reclaimprivacy.org/), and fix
them to suit your needs.

Just don't go blogging that Facebook is evil. You think you can just found a
start-up and make a [non-evil Facebook replacement](http://joindiaspora.com/)?
How long until you're sinking in the bills from the hosting company, and start
thinking that "_hey, maybe I should put ads on this thing"_, and then, when the
ads don't pay enough, you start thinking that _"hey, perhaps I should target
the ads better: I need to share more information about the users with the ad
providers"_. And so on.
