Here's a picture of my current astrophotography rig. Unfortunately, the little
adventure I've been having with the Simak 240 has unfolded itself to an early
grave, and it's my intention to have it professionally repaired and then get rid
of it.

In the picture above you can see my loyal and sturdy 10Micron GM2000, simply an
incredible piece of hardware, now sporting a GSO RC8 given to me by Samuel.

The lad has worked like a plough horse to get things running, and now we're 99%
down the road. There's a minor, but nonetheless noticeable, tilt issue on the
optical train, so I hope the good Sam will manage to fix it on his next trip to
Nerpio.
