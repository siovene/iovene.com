Here's a picture that proves that no matter how many sub-frames you do, you
still need darks. There's some worryingly low SNR in this image, it being the
sigma-kappa stack of 118 sub-frames. But then again, each frame has been
exposed for only 60 seconds, so it makes sense. I wanted to try having a really
large numbers of frames, and increase the ISO settings. Not a good idea.

Noise at ISO1600 is so much worse, with my Canon 450D, that I'll rather stick
with ISO400.

Anyway, this is an interesting picture. Right behind this beautiful cluster,
M44 aka The Beehive cluster, I spotted a tiny (for my standards) galaxy:
PGC24431. I couldn't find much about it on the Internet, except that its
magnitude is 15.2. You can identify it thanks to this progression:

It's undeniably it. If you know anything about it, please let me know.
