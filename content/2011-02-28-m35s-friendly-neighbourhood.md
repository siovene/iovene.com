The wide field streak continues uninterrupted, now that the weather is finally
giving me a well deserved break. so here I present you with my take on the area
surrounding the open cluster M35, in Gemini.  M35 is 2800 light-years away and
it spans 28 arcminutes, i.e. almost the size of the moon.  This image is the
sum of 51 3-minute shots, properly calibrated with dark and flat frames of
course.

A keen eye will also notice NGC2174, an emission nebula associated with the
star cluster NGC2175, visible in the picture left (south) of M35. Mental note
to self: image that nebula with the 80ED refractor once the guider camera is
repaired.
