category: Astronomy
tags: astrobin, astrophotography

The last 9 months have been incredibly busy, hence the lack of updates here. I
have worked on AstroBin nearly every night, for several hours; I have made a
human being; I have worked my day job; I have done some astrophotography.

AstroBin is still enjoying a linear growth, both in number of users and web
traffic, as we're nearing half a million pages viewed each month. I hope to
reach that target in January 2013. There are now over 3000 users, and the
community is more and more engaged.

I have also launched a sister site, [AstroBin
Questions](http://questions.astrobin.com/). It's a Q&A website fashioned after
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), whose goal is to steer the
astrophotography community away from the user interaction offered by forum,
which is really poor if you want objective answers to real questions. You can
read more about this on [AstroBin Questions introductory
page](http://www.astrobin.com/help/questions/).

Over the summer I've had great fun with astrophotography and my robotic
observatory in Spain, and you can see my recent photographs on [my AstroBin
page](http://www.astrobin.com/users/siovene/).

I'm now upgrading some hardware, having purchased a Simak 240
Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope, manufactured by Costruzioni Ottiche Zen.
Everything is almost in place, save the need of collimation. I hope to have a
great first light in January 2013!
