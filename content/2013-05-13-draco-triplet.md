Thanks to a few clear nights last week, Samuel, Colin and I were able to
release a new image. This time we tacked the Draco trio, a group of galaxies
some 100 Mly away: NGC5981/82/85.

The collaboration between Samuel, Colin, and me finally sees some data
contribution on my part. These are the acquisition details:

* *Samuel*: 20x900" **L**, with GSO RC10, Atik 4000, AP900.
* *Me*: 11x900" **L**, with GSO RC8, Moravian G2-1600, 10Micron GM2000.
* *Colin*: 142x300" **RGB**, with Ian King Ikharos, Atik 460ex, Paramount MX.
