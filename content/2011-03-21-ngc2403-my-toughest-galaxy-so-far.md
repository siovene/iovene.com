I'll have to revise this processing, because of a slight green tint in the
shadows and an excess of denoise and deconvolution, but I'm glad I set an
ambitious target on this easy galaxy that is not so easy with my equipment and
sky. The moon was full and brighter than usual, because of a close perigee, so
it was time to experiment. This image is the sum of 162 5-minute frames at
ISO400. That amounts to 12 hours! At least I was able to finally tame the
thermal noise that has always bothered me to no end.

NGC2403 is an intermediate spiral galaxy. That means something in between a
barred and an unbarred spiral galaxy. It belongs to the M81 group and is about
eight million light-years away.

Here's the full field:
