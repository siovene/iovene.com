title: Use Profile presets in the N900 with Tweakr
category: Software
tags: project, tweakr

A new feature in [Tweakr](https://garage.maemo.org/projects/tweakr/) allows you
to extend the sound Profiles to more than just General and Silent.

Tweakr introduces the concept of _Profile preset_. Presets are Profile settings
which can be saved, deleted and assigned to the General profile. This allows
you to practically use as many profiles as you want on the N900.

The normal use-case is to first tune the General profile for the new preset you
want to save, then open Tweakr and choose the **Save current General profile to
new preset** button. This will allow you to save the settings of the General
profile with a new name.

After that, you will find a new button in your **Status Menu**, as shown in the
following screenshot:

You can now select whatever preset you have created before, and its settings
will be applied to the General profile.

page](https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=1160)!
