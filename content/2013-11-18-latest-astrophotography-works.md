Having been outrageously busy with AstroBin from mid September up to the time
of writing, I literally had no time to process the most recent batches of
subframes I'd been collecting. At some point I didn't even have the time to
acquire any subs at all, because due to the change to DST, my mount went out of
alignment somehow.

Anyway, I can finally enjoy some respite, so let me present the most recent
images I've taken.


### NGC 7129
[![][ngc7129]][ngc7129]

NGC 7129 is a reflection nebula located 3,300 light years away in the
constellation Cepheus. A young open cluster is responsible for illuminating the
surrounding nebula. A recent survey indicates the cluster contains more than
130 stars less than 1 million years old. NGC 7129 is located just half a degree
from nearby cluster NGC 7142.  The nebula is rosebud-shaped; the young stars
have blown a large, oddly shaped bubble in the molecular cloud that once
surrounded them at their birth. The rosy pink color comes from glowing dust
grains on the surface of the bubble being heated by the intense light from the
young stars within. The ultra-violet and visible light produced by the young
stars is absorbed by the surrounding dust grains. They are heated by this
process and release the energy at longer infrared wavelengths as photographed
by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The reddish colors in the false-colour infrared
image suggest the distribution of hydrocarbon rich molecular material. The much
cooler molecular cloud outside the bubble is mostly invisible to Spitzer.
However, three very young stars near the center of the nebula are sending jets
of supersonic gas into the cloud. The collision of these jets heats carbon
monoxide molecules in the nebula. This produces the complex nebulosity that
appears like a stem of a rosebud.

### SH-2 188
[![][sh2-188]][sh2-188]

The image is of Sharpless 2-188, an unusual planetary nebula located in the
constellation Cassiopeia. The expanding gas from the planetary nebula is
colliding with ambient gas in the interstellar medium. The nebula is nearly
circular in shape but is much brighter to the southeast (lower left) because
the central star is moving rapidly in that direction. Faint wisps of gas can
also be seen in the opposite direction.

### NGC 7217
[![][ngc7217]][ngc7217]

NGC 7217 is a gas-poor system whose main features are the presence of
several rings of stars concentric to its nucleus: three main ones -being the
outermost one the most prominent and the one that features most of the gas and
star formation of this galaxy-, plus several others inside the innermost one
discovered with the help of the Hubble Space Telescope, a feature that suggests
NGC 7217's central regions have suffered several starbursts, and a very
large and massive spheroid that extends beyond its disk. Other noteworthy
features this galaxy has are the presence of a number of stars rotating in the
opposite direction around the galaxy's center to most of them and two
distinct stellar populations: one of intermediate age on its innermost regions
and a younger, metal-poor on its outermost ones. It has been suggested these
features were caused by a merger with another galaxy and, in fact, computer
simulations show that NGC 7217 could have been a large lenticular galaxy that
merged with one or two smaller gas-rich ones of late Hubble type becoming the
spiral galaxy we see today; however right now this galaxy is isolated in
space, with no nearby major companions.

### NGC 925
[![][ngc925]][ngc925]

NGC 925 is a barred spiral galaxy located about 30 million light-years away
in the constellation Triangulum. The morphological classification of this
galaxy is SB(s)d, which indicates that this has a bar structure and loosely
wound spiral arms with no ring. The spiral arm to the south is stronger than
the northern arm, with the latter appearing flocculent and less coherent. The
bar is offset from the center of the galaxy and is the site of star formation
all along its length. Both of these morphological traits -- a dominant
spiral arm and the offset bars -- are typically characteristics of a
Magellanic spiral galaxy. The galaxy is inclined at an angle of 55° to the
line of sight along a position angle of 102°. This galaxy is a member of
the NGC 1023 Group, a nearby, gravitationally-bound group of galaxies
associated with NGC 1023. However, the nearest member lies at least 650 kly
(200 kpc) distant from NGC 925. There is a 10 million solar mass cloud of
neutral hydrogen attached to NGC 925 by a streamer. It is uncertain whether
this is a satellite dwarf galaxy, the remnant of a past tidal interaction, or a
cloud of primordial gas.

### NGC 1977
[![][ngc1977]][ngc1977]

This image was acquired in conjunction with [Samuel
Díaz](http://astrob.in/users/samueldl/).

NGC 1973/5/7 is a reflection nebula 1/2 degree northeast of the Orion Nebula.
The three NGC objects are divided by darker regions. It is also called The
Running Man Nebula and Sharpless Catalog 279.  This object was named 'The
Running Man Nebula' by Texas Astronomical Society member Jason Ware.
Approximately 20 years ago his downstairs neighbor looked at the object and
said it looked like a running man. He brought this up a TAS club meeting and
the name stuck. Now widely accepted as 'The Running Man'.
