Right after imaging the Gallardd C/2009 P1 comet, I managed seven subs of five
minutes each on the Dumbbell nebula, aka M27, a planetary nebula in Vulpecula.
To be fair, M27 needs no introduction, being one of the most prominent
planetary nebulae we can enjoy.

As usual, my image lacks a lot of signal in the red channel, because regular
DSLR are, by default, [pretty much blind](/410/) in the red part of the
spectrum.

M27 has the notable characteristic of featuring a central star that is the
largest known white dwarf.
