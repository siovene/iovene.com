Fifty-one times six minutes weren't enough to capture a decent image of
NGC2683, which might just be a target out of the scope of my equipment.

> NGC 2683 is an unbarred spiral galaxy discovered by William Herschel on
> February 5, 1788. It was nicknamed the "UFO Galaxy" by the Astronaut Memorial
> Planetarium and Observatory. It is viewed nearly edge-on from Earth's location
> in space and is located between 16 to 25 million light-years away. It is
> receding from Earth at 410 km/s (250 mi/s), and from the Galactic Center at 375
> km/s (233 mi/s). The reddened light from the center of the galaxy appears
> yellowish due to the intervening gas and dust located within the outer arms of
> NGC 2683
