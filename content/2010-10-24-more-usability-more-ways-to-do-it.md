Look at the image below. It's the photograph of a keyboard very similar to the
one of the IBM ThinkPad T43.

See the keys I have highlighted? Those are the ones designed with usability in
mind.

This dialog may or may not have happened at IBM, but fact is, those page
navigation keys are way too close to the directional keys. And the Backspace,
so close to the Enter key, also raises issues.

Somebody tried to increase the usability of this keyboard by providing more
choice, more ways to do something. It turned awry instead.
