After all the dust raised again by Microsoft about Linux and the Open Source
community allegedly committing patent infringements
([235](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/index.htm?section=money_latest)
this time, they were [228](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4021775.stm) in
2004), I really feel the need to spend a few words about the matter, or then, a
few images.

It looks like the jealous Redmond's zealots, avidly fighting to protect the

been playing **copycat** for a long time, reinventing the wheel and doing a bad
job at it. Do the following screenshots tell you anything?
