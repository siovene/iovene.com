There's been a very long streak of cloudy nights, and I hear that that's the
standard fee any astrophotographer needs to pay after any purchase relative to
astrophotography. Fair enough.  Given that, as mentioned before, I haven't
modified my Canon 450D so to remove the IR-Cut filter, for the time being I
will be shooting solely objects which don't have particularly noticeable
emissions in the infrared.  This short blog post is to remind myself of the
next target: M39.

This beautiful image is also my quality target, of course, although I think it
was taken with a telescope with a diameter of 0.9m...

M39, also known as NGC7092, is a young open cluster of stars some 800 light
years away. Mostly comprised by warm blue stars, it should be aged from 230 to
300 million years. Thirty stars are proven to belong to the cluster, all inside
an imaginary sphere with a diameter of seven light years. These thirty warm
young stars shine with the brightness of 830 of our Suns.

M39 is also moving towards us at the speed of 28km/s. I sincerely hope I'll
manage to image it before it hits us in approximately 8.5 million years! _(Just
kidding: it won't probably hit us.)_
