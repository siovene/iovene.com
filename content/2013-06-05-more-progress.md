After the recent [breakthrough][1], and thanks to some precious help by
[Giancarlo Calzetta][2], I was finally able to tame the bulk of the problem.

What's left is some differential flexure, at least when imaging west. In the
meantime, I was able to produce this quick jab at M13 (thanks Samuel for the RGB
data!)

The image could be better focused (I messed with the focuser when I was in
Nerpio, but it's fine *now*) and the RGB data is not calibrated, so if you zoom
in you can see lots of colored hot pixels. I'm still happy I can see the end of
the tunnel.
