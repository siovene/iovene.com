title: 'The Blade Itself (The First Law: Book One) disappoints in my quest for the next Martin'
category: Books
tags: Abercrombie, fantasy, Martin, review

I've recently read all of the currently published books in the _A Song of Ice
and Fire_ epic fantasy saga by George R.R. Martin (I was always ahead of the TV
series, in case you wonder.)

That has left me with an insatiable hunger for _more_. After rereading the
first book, just because I had to, I decided to embark in a quest to find the
next Martin.

Alas, it seems that using Martin for my first contact with the epic fantasy
genre has spoiled me forever. I hope I'm wrong.

I'm eighty-five percent through _The Blade Itself_, the first book in the _The
First Law_ trilogy, but I reckon I'm going to set the book aside. After my
initial disappointment, I went to check the reviews on Amazon and I find myself
agreeing with all the 1-star reviews.

The number of things I dislike about the book is far greater than what I liked.

First of all, Abercrombie, the author, _tells_ too much, instead of _showing_.
The character don't act enough the way they are described. We are told several
times that Jazal is arrogant and presumptuous, but I don't remember him acting
that way.

None of the characters are likable, except Ardee, probably. Jazal is
unrealistically juvenile, sometimes infantile. Glotka is supposed to be
unlikable, a little bit of a villain, but mostly he comes out as worthy of
pity.

There's an unnecessary number of sounds, like a constant _"Er..."_ (almost
always coming from Jazal, who's just fencing, or thinking about fencing, or
talking about fencing.) I don't really need that, it really breaks the flow of
my reading.

And now the worst note: the plot is absolutely missing. There is no instrument
of tension. I can't find any reason to keep reading _just one_ page more,
or _just one_ chapter more; let alone finish the book.

I'm not worried about the fate of any of the characters; I'm not looking
forward to what's going to happen next; I don't even _care_ for any of the
characters.

If you're about to pick up this book because you liked _A Song of Ice and
Fire_, please don't.
