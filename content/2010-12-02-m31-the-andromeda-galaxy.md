And that's what I got after much struggling. Dark frames turned out to be a no
go, as I set the computer and the camera to shoot them for the rest of the
night while I enjoyed the much deserved sleep, and it turned out that the
temperature in the little storage room where I keep my stuff kept rising during
the night. Despite the room being outside and not being really that well
insulated, the sensor's temperature went from -12, to -10, to -7, to -4, to -3
and finally reaching -2. All those are centigrade degrees, of course.

Not too bad, I said to myself: forty-six frames ought to compensate for the
lack of dark frames, to some extent. Indeed the noise is under control, in the
end result.

So let's mention some interesting factual data about our neighbor, M31, the
closest spiral galaxy. Two and a half million light years far, it's nothing but
a stride away. Two-hundred thousand light years across, this beast holds a
staggering _trillion_ stars. This mesmerizing amount of stars is scattered in
the shape of a ring broken up by interference waves. A spiral galaxy without
the spiral arms? That's correct. The cause of that is M31's dwarf companion:
M32. This tiny galaxy appears to have plunged right through M31 around
two-hundred-ten million years ago, while dinosaurs where feasting on each other
unaware of all this.

Rushing through the large galaxy, M32 has created a pattern of interference
with its gravity, thusly breaking up the spiral arms, which now have settled
into a ring.

But M32 is not the only galaxy that M31 is going to cannibalize. Guess who's
next? It's us. Our own Milky Way and M31 are currently dancing a death dance
that will bring the two to a collision in about five billion years from now.
Being M31 much larger than the Milky Way, we will become engulfed, cannibalized
and assimilated, and our own identity gone forever.
