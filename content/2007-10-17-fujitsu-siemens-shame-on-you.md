I found myself in the process of realizing a dual-boot system on a laptop, with
Windows XP and [Ubuntu 7.10](http://www.ubuntu.com/). After wiping out the
content of the disk and partitioning it appropriately, I proceed to the
installation of Windows XP (knowing that I needed to install it first, since it
would overwrite the MBR and completely disregard and disrespect user's
freedom), so I put in the so-called _Recovery Disk_ provided with that
particularly Fujitsu-Siemens laptop. After a little while, the Recovery Disk
was proposing me to install Windows XP either using the full disk, or in two
partitions, with a 10 GB "data" partition. I was astonished and outraged. It
seems that the Fujitsu-Siemens people were thinking that the user wasn't smart
enough to be able to **choose** what partition use for his or her Windows
install. They would rather **limit** the user's freedom, and not give him or
her some **choice**. I suspect this was the result of some pressure from the
Microsoft end: this "trick" basically stops the user from installing other
Operating Systems along Windows, unless he or she buys a new non-branded copy.

Fujitsu-Siemens and Microsoft: shame on you!
