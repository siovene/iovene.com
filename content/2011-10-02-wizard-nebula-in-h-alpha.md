Here are seven an a half hours, split in fifteen 30-minute subs, on the Wizard
Nebula, aka NGC7380, aka Sh2-142.

> NGC 7380 is a typical starforming region in the direction of an outer spiral
> arm of our galaxy (around 7,000 light years distant). This field contains
> many young energetic stars that make the natal gas that surround them glow an
> intense pink/red. The majority of stars for this newly formed group are out
> of the field to the upper left _(right, in my image)_. Their winds and
> radiation sculpt clouds of gas and dust into the mountainous ridges seen
> here. The darkest parts of this image are foreground clouds of dust thick
> enough to extinct the light beyond them
