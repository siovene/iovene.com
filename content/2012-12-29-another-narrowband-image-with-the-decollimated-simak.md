Still 2 weeks to go before my telescope will be collimated, and I'm having some
dew problems as well.

I still managed 8.7 hours on the Cone Nebula, part of NGC 2264, a nebular
complex in Monoceros.

The O[III] data was pretty much missing, as there is nothing there: a large
patch lies right off the field, on the right size in my image. I can't wait to
do this again one the telescope is properly collimated.
