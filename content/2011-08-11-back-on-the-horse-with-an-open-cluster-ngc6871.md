Was the summer long? Yes it was! But here I am again, taking advantage of the
few dark (-ish) hours we have at night. The Astronomical Twilight hasn't
reached my latitude yet (it will on August 23rd), but at the zenith it looks
like it's dark enough for some imaging.

The image you see above is a crop to 100%, so please click through for the full
sized version. It depicts NGC6871, a young and bright star cluster in Cygnus.
The cluster should be bathing in a see of red hydrogen-alpha clouds, but my
unmodded Canon 450D is pretty much blind to that. And what you see is the stack
of mere 33 minutes! It's the only time I had before the clouds rolled in, but
the result is not too shallow.
