Today, Samuel will be awesome and fix the collimation on my Simak 240, so, I
hope, the one above is the last image to present a hideous collimation.

I spent the last two nights on Sh2-252, aka the Monkey Head nebula, a diffuse
nebula in the Orion constellation, companion to the the open cluster NGC2175. I
collected 17.7 hours of narrow band data (yay for long winter nights!)

The nebula, lying at 6,350 light-years from Earth, presents a very familiar
structure, with an oxygen rich core and hydrogen and sulfur on the outside,
creating cresting and waving gases that protrude towards the center of the
structure.

The pocket of hydrogen and sulfur right near the core is very interesting, and
I wonder how it came about, so isolated.
