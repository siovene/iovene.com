Four hours and forty-five minutes went into the making of this rendering of the
Elephant's Trunk, part of the nebulosity around the open cluster IC1396.

The elongated cloud you see in the image, resembling the trunk of an elephant,
is really over 20 light-years long, and the whole complex is 2400 light-years
away from Earth.

This bright emission area is thought to be a star forming region.
