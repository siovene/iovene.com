After spending a few months imaging with my robotic observatory on the
mountains of southern Spain, where the skies are dark and usually clear, I
thought I'd start giving some real work to my [10Micron
GM2000](http://www.10micron.com/) mount.

It's a beast capable of carrying payloads up to 50 kg, so my SkyWatcher 80ED
was rather puny on top of it.

I have purchased a second-hand **Simak 240**, manufactured by [Costruzioni
Ottiche Zen](http://www.costruzioniottichezen.com/), and due to bad weather and
a series of, let's say, circumstances, it's been a while until I could get
first light through it.

We're talking about a 250 mm (10") Maksutov-Cassegrain, with a focal length of
1350 mm.

Unfortunately, there were some mishaps during collimation, and I'm now left
with some pinching on one of the mirrors that I hope will be fixed soon.

As I write, Nerpio's skies look like this:

I have programmed an imaging session in [CCD
Commander](http://ccdcommander.com/)Â that will take 10-minute subs on M33 and
M81, and the first one just came in, so have a look:

As you can see, the focus is not perfect, because, I assume, [FocusMax
](http://www.focusmax.org/)has trouble with badly collimated optics, and the
stars show a triangular shape.

But all in all, it looks like I'm off to a good start and I'll take some really
nice image in 2013!
