title: About

Welcome to my personal website. I am a computer programmer from Naples (Italy),
currently working in Espoo (Finland) as a Linux Software Engineer
at [Intel](http://www.intel.com/). I have worked at
[Nokia](http://www.nokia.com/) in the past, and focused on the
[Maemo](http://maemo.nokia.com/) platform since early 2007. I have been part of
the development of the Nokia [N900](http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/) mobile
computer, and, later, the [N9](http://swipe.nokia.com/) phone, which ran an
operating system considered a hybrid between Maemo and
[MeeGo](http://www.meego.com/).

Currently, I'm working on the [Tizen](http://www.tizen.org/) platform.

On the side, I'm the founder of [AstroBin](http://www.astrobin.com/), a popular
image hosting platform for astrophotographers.

I can boast a vast area of expertise, with good knowledge of C, C++, Python and
Javascript, as you can read in my [résumé](/pages/resume/).

This website includes snippets from my personal thoughts, life, ideologies and
hobbies.
