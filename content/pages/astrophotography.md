title: Astrophotography

As you have undoubtedly noted, this website sports a fair amount of my
astrophotography.  I've been involved with astronomy since before my teens. I
think I was eleven or twelve when I stumbled upon Stephen Hawking's "A brief
history of time." Little did I know, but that was like tripping right at the
top of a hill, and then starting to uncontrollably roll down.

I recall reading lots of books on the subject, and subscribing to magazines.
When I was about fourteen I was given my first telescope: a 114mm Newtonian
telescope on a German equatorial mount. A pretty shaky one at it, but it did
for several years.

I've always lived in moderately to heavily light polluted areas, but somehow
those 114 millimeters have served me well, on and off for the good part of the
following fifteen years. I have lugged the whole setup up three flights of
stairs, many times, in order to observe the few planets and Messier object my
site allowed, over and over again.

In 2005, I moved from Italy to Finland and I left the telescope behind. I
didn't forget astronomy though, as I continued to read the occasional book, and
get the news in my RSS reader. Still, the whole thing went under the radar for
a bit, then one night, while in France at the end of my honeymoon, I went out
at night. I was walking with my new wife right in front of the hotel where we
were staying that night. It had been a long day as we cycled for over 80
kilometers (yeah, that's the kind of honeymoon I had!)

The hotel was sort of in the middle of nowhere, away from sources of light
pollution, and the view of the sky was pretty amazing. The Milky Way was faint
and, well, milky; but the sky was pierced by countless pinpoints of light,
shining from far, far above.

I rushed back to the room, took my DSLR from the backpack, and placed it on a
makeshift platform made of books, on the window shelf. I took a thirty-second
exposure of a random patch of sky.

To my delight, the M31 galaxy (aka the Andromeda Galaxy) was clearly visible in
the shot!

That was the beginning of a journey that was long overdue. I don't know why it
hadn't occurred to me before, but astrophotography was the natural evolution
for my interest in astronomy. It's the perfect polygamous marriage between the
three major things that enthrall me: astronomy, engineering and creative
art.
