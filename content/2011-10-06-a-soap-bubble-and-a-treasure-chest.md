Only three hours could go into the making of this peculiar portrait, picturing
the beautiful Bubble Nebula, aka NGC7635, and the bright open cluster M52.

The Bubble is an area of ionized hydrogen, currently being blown away by the
stellar wind of a massive and hot central star, whose mass is believed to be
twenty to forty times that of our Sun. The Bubble extends over a diameter of
about 10 light-years, lies 11000 light-years away and is a set for very violent
and turbulent processes at work.
