At the end of November 2013, [Samuel](http://astrob.in/users/samueldl/) and I
have turned our telescopes towards the Abell 426 galaxy cluster in Perseus.

This image is the result of **43.5 hours** worth of data, structured as
follows:

* Luminance: **30x1200"**, GSO RC10, Atik 4000, Paramount MX
* H&alpha;: **15x3600"**, GSO RC8, Moravian Instuments G2-1600, 10Micron GM2000
* RGB: **222x300"** bin2, GSO RC8, Moravian Instruments G2-1600, 10Micron GM2000

The image can be seen on AstroBin as well: [Abell 426 on

**From Wikipedia:** *The Perseus Cluster (Abell 426) is a cluster of galaxies
in the constellation Perseus. It has a recession speed of 5,366 km/s and a
diameter of 863'.  It is one of the most massive objects in the universe,
containing thousands of galaxies immersed in a vast cloud of multimillion
degree gas.*
