After riding for a few years on a [Marin Alp Fairfax][1], a hybrid bike with
road ambitions, I decided it was time to gift me with something better.

With my birthday coming up, and taking advantage of the fact that I was in
Italy for some time, in Veneto, a region densely packed with cyclists, I went
bike shopping.

This Trek Madone 3.5 was the bike of the year 2012, and is a great compromise of
speed and comfort. Great bang for the buck, and 20% off because it's last year's
model.

It's got a Shimano Ultegra group and Shimano 105 brakes.

I [took it for a ride][1] yesterday and it really felt like night and day
compared to my previous bike. This thing accelerates like it has a will of its
own. It's easier to reach faster speeds and maintain them. The group shift with
a quiet click and it feels very appeasing.

Now I'm going to have to hope for good day weather **and** night weather. Is
that too much to ask?
