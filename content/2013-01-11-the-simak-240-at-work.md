Here's a picture of my new workhorse, a [Costruzioni Ottiche Zen "Simak
240"][2], a 10" Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope. This picture was taken by my
friend [Samuel][3], who was working on improving the collimation of the
secondary mirror.

This optical scheme, known as Simak, was designed by Mike Simmons, and has
recently been improved upon. The ample flat field makes this scheme very fit
for astrophotography.

I hope I can show some excellent images in the next few months.
