M101 is a beautiful face-on spiral galaxy. Unfortunately I could only take 11
ten-minute frames of this jewel, and I will certainly do more when I will be
able too again. Summer is closing in, and nights are getting shorter and
shorter.

> The Pinwheel Galaxy, as it's known, is 25 million light-years away and with a
> diameter of 170,000 light-years it is nearly twice the size of the Milky Way.
> It has a disk mass on the order of 100 billion solar masses, along with a
> small bulge of about 3 billion solar masses.  Another remarkable property of
> this galaxy is its huge and extremely bright H II regions, of which a total
> of about 3,000 can be seen on photographs. H II regions usually accompany the
> enormous clouds of high density molecular hydrogen gas contracting under
> their own gravitational force where stars form. H II regions are ionized by
> large numbers of extremely bright and hot young stars.  On photographs M101
> can be seen to be asymmetrical on one side. It is thought that in the recent
> past (speaking in galactic terms) M101 underwent a near collision with
> another galaxy and the associated gravitational tidal forces caused the
> asymmetry. In addition, this encounter also amplified the density waves in
> the spiral arms of M101. The amplification of these waves leads to the
> compression of the interstellar hydrogen gas, which then triggers strong star
> formation activity ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_101)).
