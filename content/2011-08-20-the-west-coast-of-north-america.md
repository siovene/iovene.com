Great news! I got my first CCD camera: a [Moravian Instruments
G2-1600](http://ccd.mii.cz/art?id=321). It's got a Kaf-1603ME sensor, so it's a
very sensitive NABG camera. I got narrow band filters too, so expect some
images in the Hubble palette.

The image you see in this post was shot through a 12nm O-III filter.

It depicts what is usually put on the left in images of the North America
nebula, NGC 7000.
