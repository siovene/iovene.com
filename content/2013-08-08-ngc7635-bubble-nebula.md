This time, taking advantage of the New Moon nights, I went for a relatively
easy and widely popular target: the Bubble Nebula, NGC 7635.

Here's a quote from Wikipedia:

> NGC 7635, also called the Bubble Nebula, Sharpless 162, or Caldwell 11, is a
> H II region emission nebula in the constellation Cassiopeia. It lies close
> to the direction of the open cluster Messier 52. The "bubble" is created by
> the stellar wind from a massive hot, 8.7 magnitude young central star, the
> 15 ± 5 M☉ SAO 20575 (BD+60 2522). The nebula is near a giant molecular
> cloud which contains the expansion of the bubble nebula while itself being
> excited by the hot central star, causing it to glow. It was discovered in
> 1787 by William Herschel. The star SAO 20575 or BD+602522 is thought to
> have a mass of 10-40 Solar masses.

And this is what APOD has to say about it:

> Blown by the wind from a massive star, this interstellar apparition has a
> surprisingly familiar shape. Cataloged as NGC 7635, it is also known simply
> as The Bubble Nebula. Although it looks delicate, the 10 light-year diameter
> bubble offers evidence of violent processes at work. Above and right of the
> Bubble's center is a hot, O star, several hundred thousand times more
> luminous and around 45 times more massive than the Sun. A fierce stellar wind
> and intense radiation from that star has blasted out the structure of glowing
> gas against denser material in a surrounding molecular cloud. The intriguing
> Bubble Nebula lies a mere 11,000 light-years away toward the boastful
> constellation Cassiopeia.

For my interpretation, I used L, Hα, and RGB filters, for a total integration
time of 19 hours.

The image can be seen on [AstroBin as well][1].
