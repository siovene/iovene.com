I had hoped, for a brief moment, that my elongated star were the result of
guiding problem. I made a [short video][2] of my aligned subs on NGC 3628, and
that gave me some prospect that the optical train were not tilted.

Alas, it was short lived. I made a few tests to examine the diffraction spikes,
and as you can see in the image above, and also [here][3] and [here][4], there
is a double-spike mishap.

The waiting game continues, until the next time the problem can be
troubleshooted.
