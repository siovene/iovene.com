This is my picture of NGC869/884, aka the Double Cluster.

Have you ever fathomed the idea that the corner of the galaxy in which we
reside, while not being very poor, is missing some sparkle? The stars around us
are pretty dully distributed, to be honest, and although I'm not complaining,
we could've had it much more interesting. If you were a little green man living
on a planet somewhere between NGC869 and NGC884, the two components of the
renowned Double Cluster of Perseus, you'd be in for an eyeful.

These two clusters, which are at 6800 and 7600 light-years from us, and yet
visible with your bare eyes under dark skies, are only 800 light-years from one
another. If you were somewhere in the middle, say 150 light-years from the
larger one, how would it appear? Let's do some math.

The brightest stars there have an apparent magnitude of 7. Their absolute
magnitude can be calculated as follows:

$latex 7 - 5(Log(\frac{7000}{3.2616})-1) = -4.65$

where 7000/3.2616 is the distance in parsecs.  Let us not calculate the
apparent magnitude of such stars as seen from a planet only 150 light-years
away:

$latex -4.65 + 5 (Log(\frac{150}{3.2616}) - 1) = -1.33$

Imagine200 stars of apparent magnitude -1.33, spread across an area as large as
the Triangulum constellation. The light shining from there would be enough for
you to read.
