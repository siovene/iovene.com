Hopefully this is the second-last decollimated image with my new telescope (I'm
working on NGC 2175, and it should be finished before Samuel fixes my
collimation.)

18.3 hours in narrowband revealed a surprising amount of S[II] emissions, and
some O[III] too, right on the crest.

I would've bothered to collect better data, as I forgot to take the Moon into
account, and my O[III] channel was afflicted by a gradient, although nothing
PixInsight couldn't solve satisfactorily. However, it was not worth spending
more time than that with a decollimated telescope. The loss of detail is quite
bad, but still I got a good image out of it, so I can't complain.
