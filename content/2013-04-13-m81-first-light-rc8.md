It's been a long 7 months since I purchased a second-hand Simak 240 that turned
out to be afflicted by some pinching. Despite the best efforts by my friend
Samuel, who doesn't live too far from my remote observatory, it could not be
fixed.

Several trips, several attempts, and it would just not go away. As I have
resolved to send the telescope to the original manufacturer for repairing,
Samuel gave me his RC8.

It's an 8 incher instead of the 10 incher I had originally bought, and a little
slow at F/8 (compared to the Simak 240 at F/5.6), but it's well tested and it
was already in Nerpio, so it only needed to be transferred to my mount.

After an incredible string of bad weather, in what has turned out to be the
rainiest winter in Spain in recorded history, finally Samuel took a chance and
travelled to the observatory location to install his telescope (soon to be
mine) on my staunch GM2000.

Here's my first light, which I'm very happy about. The seeing was terrible last
night, and I think the collimation could be improved, but I'm glad the
nightmare is pretty much over.

Now I'll have to ship the Simak to Venice, hometown of *Costruzioni Ottiche
Zen*, have them repair it and certify that it works fine now. Then I'll try to
sell it on the Italian territory.

I hope that my being well known in the astronomy community thanks to my work on
AstroBin will shadow the fact that I can't show any good pictures made with the
Simak 240.
